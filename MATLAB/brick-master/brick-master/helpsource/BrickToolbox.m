%
% The _Brick_ toolbox is a set of handy general functions aimed at making
% Matlab programming faster and more convenient.
%
% While a number of them are simple shortcuts that avoid always rewriting
% the same pieces of code, the toolbox also includes advanced mathematical
% functions and GUI interfaces, yet in the general spirit that these
% functions should be usefull in a wide range of contexts.
%
% To get started, go for a <Highlights1.html tour> of some functions, or directly go to the
% full <functbycat.html function reference>.
