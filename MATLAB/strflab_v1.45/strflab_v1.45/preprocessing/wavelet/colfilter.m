% function Y = colfilter(X, h)
% Filter the columns of image X using filter vector h, without decimation.
% If length(h) is odd, each output sample is aligned with each input sample
% and Y is the same size as X.
% If length(h) is even, each output sample is aligned with the mid point
% of each pair of input samples, and size(Y) = size(X) + [1 0];
