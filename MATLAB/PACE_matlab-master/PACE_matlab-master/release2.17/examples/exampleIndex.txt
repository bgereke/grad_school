9) example_GFLM.m:	Example for iterGFLM.m

  Predictors are balanced data simulated from 
  X_i(t)=\sum_{k=1}^4 r_{ik} phi_k(t) 
  where i=1,...,100. Each predictor trajectory is sampled  at 20 equally-spaced time points in [0,1],   r_{ik} are distributed as N(0,lamba_k) with variance lambda_k equal to 1, 0.5, 0.25, 0.125 and phi_k, k=1,...,4  are chosen from the first four elements of the Fourier basis. Responses are generated according to  Y_i=binomial(1,pi), where logit(pi)=1 + \int beta*X_i and beta is a linear combination of the phi_k. The program iterGFLM can be used to estimate beta and pi. It makes use of the 
SPQR (SemiParametric Quasi-likelihood Regression) algorithm.
