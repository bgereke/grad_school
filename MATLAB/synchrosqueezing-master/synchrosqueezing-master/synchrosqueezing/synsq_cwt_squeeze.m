% function [Tx,fs] = synsq_cwt_squeeze(Wx, w, t, nv, opt)
%
% Calculates synchrosqueezed transform of f on a logarithmic
% scale.  Used internally by synsq_cwt_fw.
%
% Input:
%   Wx: wavelet transform of x
%   w: estimate of frequency at locations in Wx (see synsq_cwt_fw code)
%   t: time vector
%   nv: number of voices
%   opt: options struct, not currently used
%
% Output:
%   Tx: synchrosqueezed output
%   fs: associated frequencies
%
% Note the multiplicative correction term f in synsq_cwt_squeeze_mex (and in
% the matlab equivalent code commented out), required due to the fact that
% the squeezing integral of Eq. (2.7), in, [1], is taken w.r.t. dlog(a).
% This correction term needs to be included as a factor of Eq. (2.3), which
% we implement here.
%
% A more detailed explanation is available in Sec. III of [2].
% Specifically, this is an implementation of Sec. IIIC, Alg. 1.
% Note the constant multiplier log(2)/nv has been moved to the
% inverse of the normalization constant, as calculated in synsq_adm.m
