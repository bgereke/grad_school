# Matlab scripts

In addition to those I developed, this archive includes many external libraries I either used or studied during my PhD work.

* Batch wrangling and preprocessing of neurophyiology data (e.g., across animals, days, etc.)
* Various aproaches to time-frequency decomposition (i.e., wavelet transforms, empirical mode decomp, reassignment methods, matching pursuits, dictionary learning, etc.).
* Various time series clustering methods (i.e., for clustering neural spikes, learning shapes/patterns from local field potentials, etc.)
* Decoding of rodent behavior from hippocampal place cell and field potential data
* Various utilities for data smoothing, interpolation, density estimation, etc.
* Frequency-resolved dimensionality reduction methods for high channel-count neurophysiology data with a focus on limiting common artifacts (e.g., volume conduction, muscle, chewing, artifacts, etc.)
