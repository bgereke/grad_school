function code = tennisCourt
% tennisCourt   Code for the ViRMEn experiment tennisCourt.
%   code = tennisCourt   Returns handles to the functions that ViRMEn
%   executes during engine initialization, runtime and termination.


% Begin header code - DO NOT EDIT
code.initialization = @initializationCodeFun;
code.runtime = @runtimeCodeFun;
code.termination = @terminationCodeFun;
% End header code - DO NOT EDIT



% --- INITIALIZATION code: executes before the ViRMEn engine starts.
function vr = initializationCodeFun(vr)



% --- RUNTIME code: executes on every iteration of the ViRMEn engine.
function vr = runtimeCodeFun(vr)



% --- TERMINATION code: executes after the ViRMEn engine stops.
function vr = terminationCodeFun(vr)
