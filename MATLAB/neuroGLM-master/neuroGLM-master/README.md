neuroGLM
=========================

Supports flexible regression analyses of trial-based spike train data
using a Generalized Linear Model (GLM). This modeling framework aims
to discover how neural responses encode both external (e.g., sensory,
motor, reward variables) and internal (e.g., spike history, LFP
signals) covariates of the response.

This MATLAB code is a reference implementation for the analyses found
in [Park et al. 2014](http://pillowlab.princeton.edu/pubs/abs_ParkI_NN14.html).

Simple Overview
-------------

Suppose we record spike responses from a single neuron during a
complex behavioral experiment, and would like to know what aspects of
the stimulus or behavior are encoded in the neural response. This code
package allows us to discover such dependencies using Poisson GLM
regression.

Consider a simple example in which a neuron encodes two experimental
variables: the time at which a visual target appears, and the motion
strength of a moving-dots stimulus. The regressors are
the time at which the targets appear, and the time,
duration, and strength ("coherence") of the moving dots on each
trial.
