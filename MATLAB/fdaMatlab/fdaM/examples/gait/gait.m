%% Introduction to the gait data for 39 boys

%%
% The Motion Analysis Laboratory at Children's Hospital, San Diego, CA, 
% collected these data, which consist of the angles formed by the hip and 
% knee of each of 39 children over each child's gait cycle.  The data 
% analyzed here have been the subject of many papers, but our reference
% is Oshen, et al (1989) Gait analysis and the bootstrap. Annals of 
% Statistics, 17, 1419-1440.

%%
% Time is measured in terms of the proportion of the individual gait cycle, 
% which we have translated into values of $t$ in $[0,1]$. The cycle 
% begins when the heel of the limb under observation strikes the ground. 
% Both sets of functions are treated as being periodic.

%%
% The gait cycle as displayed in these data has four phases:
% 
% # At the heel strike, the other foot is still in contact with the floor,
%   and the first phase lasts until the other foot leaves the floor, which
%   occurs at about 19% of the gait cycle.  The weight of the body is 
%   transferred to the side being plotted.
% # The other foot leaves the floor moves from behind the limb being 
%   plotted to the point where the other heel strikes the floor.  During
%   this phase the plotted leg is bearing all of the weight of the body.
%   The knee angle is near zero to minimize muscle loading during this time
%   of maximal load.  The hip angle continues to decrease, however, as the
%   leg continues to move to the rear.  This phase lasts about 31% of the
%   gait cycle, so that for about 62% of the cycle the body is being
%   supported by only one leg.  
% # The other heel strikes the floor, but the foot on the plotted side
%   is still in contact with the floor.  Since gait is nearly bilaterally
%   symmetric, this point is roughly at the mid-point
%   of the cycle.  This phase lasts until the plotted foot
%   leaves the floor at about the 68% point of the cycle.  
% # When the plotted foot leaves the floor, all the weight is transferred
%   to the other side, and this phases lasts until the plotted heel again
%   strikes the floor.
% 

%%
% There are many interesting questions concerning these data.
% 
% * We want to consider registering the data.  The starting point
%   for each record is the time of the heel strike, but this is an
%   interaction with the environment that may a complex relationship to
%   the dynamics for heel and knee angle, as well as to their interaction.
% * What are the relative importances of amplitude and phase variation in
%   these gait cycles?  If we want to diagnose gait problems, which of
%   should we focus on?
% * Where does most of the energy come from that defines gait?  What is
%   the relative importance of the hip and the knee?
% * Heel strikes and toe lifts mark boundaries in the gait cycle, but
%   can we see these plus any other markers directly in the hip and knee
%   angles?
% * To some extend knee angle must be dependent on hip angle, since one
%   suspects that the swing of the lower leg from back to front in
%   preparation for the next heel strike is partially propelled by hip 
%   motion.

gaitbasis = create_fourier_basis([0,1], 21);

%%
% We will apply a small amount of penalty to the roughness of the data.
% There is a certain amount of error due to both measurement and the
% discretization of the angles, and angles are consequently only accurate 
% to within about three degrees.
% 
% Since the data are periodic and even roughly sinusoidal, it is 
% reasonable to penalize the total harmonic acceleration.  Here we set
% up the linear differential operator that annihilates a shifted
% sinusoid with period one.

%%
% The first time of observation is shown as a blue circle, and one 
% along a phase-plane trajectory in a clockwise manner.  

%%
% The plot shows two sharp cusps, both with near zero acceleration. 
% Zero acceleration applies constant velocity, and indicates that
% forces acting on the hip at relatively neutralized at that point.
% The first cusp is close to the initial heel strike. Counting times,
% the second cusp comes at 37.5% or 3/8 of the gait cycle, about at
% the mid point of the second phase, when the leg is carrying the 
% body's weight alone and leg is fully extended.  The fact that a 
% number of time points coalesce at this time indicates that this
% is an interval of stationarity, rather than a point, and corresponds
% roughly to the second phase.  After this point, the hip angle 
% undergoes a large nearly harmonic swing in its values, with the large
% diameter of this swing indicating a great deal of energy.

%%
% In spite of what we see in the plot of hip angles themselves, the hip
% is undergoing a three-phase process, while the knee is a two-phase
% process.  This suggests that a good deal of the coordination and
% power in gait comes from hip articulation.

%%
% The knee phase-plane plot also shows a relatively stationary period
% corresponding to the second cusp in the hip cycle.

%% Display the variance and covariance functions
