# R scripts

* Batch preprocessing of neurophyiology data (e.g., across animals, days, etc.)
* Point process predictive models of spiking neural data, rodent licking behavior, sparse spectrogram features, etc.
* Comparisons of various flavors of generalized additive models (i.e., GAM, GAMM, GAMLSS, etc.) applied to calcium imaging data, spiking neural data, time-frequency-decomposed local field potential data, rodent behavior, etc.
* Embarrassingly parallel scripts (e.g., cross-validation routines, resampling methods, etc.) that were run on UT's HPC resources (i.e., Stampede)  
* Different methods for computing confidence intervals for such models (i.e., simultaneous ci's from parametric, nonparametric bootstraps, jacknifes, etc.)
